            <h2>About the Project</h2>
            <p>This web application uses a deep learning model (ResNet50V2) trained on a comprehensive dataset of plant images to identify various diseases across multiple plant species:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Apple Diseases:</strong> Including scab, black rot, and cedar apple rust</li>
                <li><strong>Corn Diseases:</strong> Such as common rust, gray leaf spot, and northern leaf blight</li>
                <li><strong>Grape Diseases:</strong> Including black rot, esca, and leaf blight</li>
                <li><strong>Tomato Diseases:</strong> Such as early blight, late blight, and leaf mold</li>
                <li><strong>And many more:</strong> Covering 38 different plant health conditions</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The model was trained on high-quality images to ensure accurate detection of various plant diseases, helping farmers and gardeners identify problems early for better crop management.</p>
            
            <h3>How to get the best results:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Use clear, well-lit photos of leaves</li>
                <li>Focus on the affected area of the plant</li>
                <li>Take photos against a neutral background when possible</li>
                <li>Include both sides of the leaf if symptoms appear differently</li>
            </ol>
